				<h1>Welcome to CAS Montana!</h1>
				<br>
				<p>
					The two neighboring resorts of Crans and Montana are situated at an altitude of 1500 m on a sun-drenched plateau high above the Rhone Valley. Together they form one of the biggest holiday destinations in the Valais.
				</p>
				<p>
					These twin towns have much to offer, including an impressive view of the chain of mountain peaks from the Matterhorn to Mont Blanc and a particularly wide programme of activities all year round. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Idyllic mountain village or alpine town? Crans-Montana embodies both and combines all the comforts of a modern holiday resort with an expansive natural landscape and panoramic views of the Valais Alps. The modern side of Crans-Montana offers the most extensive alpine shopping for miles around. It also boasts a renowned cultural and congress centre; and a wide range of accommodation. As a venue for major sporting events, and with a reputation as a golfing Mecca, Crans-Montana draws visitors from all over the world. 
				</p>
				<p class= "pLastMain">
					Commune with nature in this family-friendly resort, where you can enjoy five swimming lakes; walks through aromatic mountain forests along an extensive network of footpaths; and cosy fondue evenings in rustic inns.
